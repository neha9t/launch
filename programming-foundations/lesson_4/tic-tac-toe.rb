marks a square on the board. First player to reach 3 squares in a row, including diagonals,
wins. If all 9 squares are marked and no player has 3 squares in a row, then the game is a tie.

2. Ask the user to mark a square.
3. Computer marks a square.
4. Display the updated board state.
5. If winner, display winner.
6. If board is full, display tie.
7. If neither winner nor board is full, go to #2
8. Play again?
9. If yes, go to #1
10. Good bye
